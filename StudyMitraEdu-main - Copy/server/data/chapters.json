Why do we eat a variety of food items?\nAns:\nOur body needs different nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. No single food can provide all nutrients, so we must eat a variety of food items for a balanced diet and good health.\n\nQ4.

If plants or animals disappear, we will not have enough food to survive. They also maintain ecological balance.\n\nQ4. A student prepared fruit salad using apple, banana, and mango.
